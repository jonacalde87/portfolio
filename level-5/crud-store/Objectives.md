# Overview
This exercise is your first foray into implementing mongoose into your express server. You will be making a CRUD e-store inventory. Use postman to interface with all the items in your database.

## Part 1
[X] - Build a new server and connect it to mongodb.
[X] - In a folder called `models` create a file called `inventory.js` and define a `InventorySchema` for items in your store. Export a `InventoryModel` at the bottom.

## Part 2
[X] - Create a new folder called `routes` containing a file `inventory.js`.
[X] - Create all the necessary routes to make a fully CRUD application (GET, GET(one), POST, PUT, DELETE, ).
[X] - Populate your inventory using Postman. Be sure to test each endpoint.
