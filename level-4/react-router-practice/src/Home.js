       Hello! My name is Jonathan, and I have a passion for learning and developing websites. 
       When I am not coding, you will find me learning more about carnivorous plants in my backyard. 
       have a saying, "if you are not teaching something, you should be learning something." </p>

       <p>
        I started my professional journey by serving in the US Army. After my service, 
        I completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Software Development from Bellevue University. 
        I built many great relationships during my service, which made me grow into the professional individual I am today.         
        I am currently enrolled in V School to solidify my skills and obtain more web development experience.
       </p>
