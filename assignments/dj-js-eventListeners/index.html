    <h1>This website was created that a user can change the color of a square. <br>
        The square will react to the mouse action the user do. <br>
        <ul id="my-list"> The square's color will change as follows:
            <li>Blue - when the mouse hovers over the square; or user press the letter "b"</li>
            <li>Red - when the mouse button is held down over the square; or user press the letter "r"</li>
            <li>Yellow - when the mouse button is let go over the square; or user press the letter "y"</li>
            <li>Green - when the mouse is double clicked in the square; or user press the letter "g"</li>
            <li>Orange - when the mouse scroll is used somewhere in the window (not just over the square); 
                or user press the letter "o"</li>            
        </ul>
